## Kubernetes Home Lab (home-k8s)

In my most recent knowledge ventures, I've been working towards rounding-off my skillset with Kubernetes while strengthening my CI/CD and DevOps concepts.

This lab is hosted on three separate Raspberry Pi 5's running Raspberry Pi OS Lite; One control-plane and two worker nodes.
